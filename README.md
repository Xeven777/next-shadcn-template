### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check by running `node -v` in your terminal. If not, download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. **You can either use this as a template or git clone it:**

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Xeven777/next-shadcn-template.git

   ```

This will create a new directory named `next-shadcn-template` in your current directory.

2. **Remove the old `.git` directory and initialize a new one:**
   Navigate to the new `next-shadcn-template` directory and run the following commands:

   ```sh
   cd next-shadcn-template
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm/bun install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   After installing the dependencies, start the development server by running:

   ```sh
   npm/bun run dev
   ```

   Now, you should be able to see the application running at `localhost:3000` in your web browser! ✨
